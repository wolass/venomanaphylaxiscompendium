abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Epinephrine is a life-saving medication in the treatment of anaphylaxis, in which it has multiple beneficial pharmacologic effects. Here, we examine the evidence base for its primary role in the treatment of anaphylaxis episodes in community settings. RECENT FINDINGS We review the practical pharmacology of epinephrine in anaphylaxis, its intrinsic limitations, and the pros and cons of different routes of administration. We provide a new perspective on the adverse effects of epinephrine, including its cardiac effects. We describe the evidence base for the use of epinephrine in anaphylaxis. We discuss the role of epinephrine auto-injectors for treatment of anaphylaxis in community settings, including identification of patients who need an auto-injector prescription, current use of auto-injectors, and advances in auto-injector design. We list reasons why physicians fail to prescribe epinephrine auto-injectors for patients with anaphylaxis, and reasons why patients fail to self-inject epinephrine in anaphylaxis. We emphasize the primary role of epinephrine in the context of emergency preparedness for anaphylaxis in the community. SUMMARY Epinephrine is the medication of choice in the first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis in the community. For ethical reasons, it is not possible to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials of epinephrine in anaphylaxis; however, continued efforts are needed towards improving the evidence base for epinephrine injection in this potentially fatal disease.},

@article{Braganza2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Data on acute paediatric anaphylaxis presentations to the emergency department (ED) are limited. All allergic presentations to one Australian paediatric ED were studied to determine epidemiological, clinical, and outcome data. METHODS Retrospective, case based study of patients under 16 years attending one metropolitan, paediatric teaching hospital ED in Australia over three years. The medical records of patients presenting with generalised allergic reactions and anaphylaxis satisfying relevant ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes were studied. The incidence, age, sex ratio, co-morbidities, likely aetiology, clinical features, management, and disposal were determined. RESULTS A total of 526 children with generalised allergic reactions, and 57 with anaphylaxis were included in the study. This represented incidences of 9.3:1000 ED presentations for generalised allergic reactions and 1:1000 for anaphylaxis. There were no fatalities. In anaphylaxis cases, a cause was recognised in 68.4{\%}. Cutaneous features were present in 82.5{\%}. A past history of asthma was reported in 36.8{\%}. Adrenaline was used in 39.3{\%} of severe anaphylaxis cases. The ED alone definitively cared for 97.8{\%} of all patients. Follow up was inadequate in cases of anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS This is the first reported incidence figure for paediatric anaphylaxis ED presentations in Australia, and is less than that reported in adults in the same local population. However, the incidence of generalised allergic reactions of 9.3:1000 was greater than in the adults. Virtually all paediatric allergic cases may be managed in the ED alone, provided that the importance of specialist follow up, particularly for severe anaphylaxis, is recognised.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of perioperative anaphylaxis should always be considered. The incidence of anesthetic allergic reactions is controversial, varying from 1/3,000 to 1/20,000, with mortality range between 3 and 9{\%}. This report describes the use of methylene blue as coadjuvant drug to treat anaphylaxis refractory to conventional therapy. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old male patient was submitted to inguinal hernia correction under spinal anesthesia. After receiving 1.5 g intravenous dipirone at surgery completion, he immediately developed bronchospasm, cyanosis, decreased SpO 2 and SBP, culminating with cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was started with external cardiac massage followed by tracheal intubation, as well as 1 mg epinephrine and 1 mg atropine injections. Heart rate returned (150 bpm) with no palpable pulse though. Additional 1 mg epinephrine and 1 g hydrocortisone were administered with central pulse recovery (8 minutes). Although receiving dopamine (20 $\mu$g.kg -1.min -1), patient remained hypotensive (60 mmHg) until 80 minutes. Intravenous 100 mg methylene blue was then administered with increased SBP to 85 and 105 mmHg after the second dose. Dopamine dose was tapered from 10 to 7, 5 and finally 2 $\mu$g.kg -1.min -1. CONCLUSIONS: Histamine is the major anaphylaxis mediator. Inducing nitric oxide (NO) production, it consequently increases guanylate cyclase, which promotes arteriolar vasodilation by increasing cyclic GMP. Methylene blue may be helpful in such situations because it inhibits guanylate cyclase and consequently vasodilation, resulting in hemodynamic improvement.},

abstract = {Learning Objectives: Distributive shock is common in the critically ill patient. Resuscitation with fluids and catecholamine agents have become standard of care. Methylene blue (MB) has been proposed as an alternative treatment of shock. Methods: A 67-yrold male with history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia on cycle 2 of bendamustine and rituximab, with recent admission for rash and hypotension attributed to allopurinol after cycle 1, developed shortness of breath, chest tightness, and abdominal discomfort while receiving chemotherapy. Treatment was stopped and the patient received fluids, steroids, and diphenhydramine. He became tachycardic, hypertensive, and hypoxic. The patient was intubated for airway protection. Physical exam revealed a diffuse, blanching erythematous rash. Upon arrival to the intensive care unit, he remained normotensive and extremities were well-perfused. He received additional fluids, steroids, and antihistamines. Several hours later, he developed hypotension necessitating initiation of vasopressors. Elevated tryptase level was consistent with clinical diagnosis of anaphylactic shock. Shock was refractory to maximal support on four vasopressors. A four-hour MB infusion was started at 0.5 mg/kg/hr and titrated to 2 mg/kg/hr. Shock improved and the patient was weaned down to three vasopressors. After a short period of time, he again became hypotensive on maximal vasopressor support. Another MB infusion was started and the patient was weaned down to two vasopressors. He did not require additional doses of methylene blue. The patient improved and was discharged home. Results: Reported use of MB for anaphylaxis is limited. Effect of MB on vasodilation has mostly been studied in sepsis. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production is associated with loss of vascular tone in vasodilatory shock. MB inhibits NO-induced guanylate cyclase activation and increases smooth muscle tone. MB may be an effective alternative treatment to restoring vascular tone in anaphylactic shock as evident in our case.

abstract = {We present two cases of catecholamine-refractory and vasopressin-refractory vasoplegic syndrome associated with intraoperative anaphylaxis during cardiac surgery. One case was related to the administration of protamine and the other case to the administration of aprotinin. Both cases were successfully managed using intravenous methylene blue. The use of methylene blue blocks accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate by competitively inhibiting the enzyme guanylate cyclase. This results in reduced responsiveness of the vasculature to cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated vasodilators, such as nitric oxide. This report provides a description of severe anaphylaxis induced by different agents, in which the use of methylene blue was associated with a significant clinical response. ?? 2009 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction. To identify biomarkers for the condition, we assessed serum levels of apolipoprotein (Apo)A and ApoE. We found a reduction of both lipoproteins in anaphylactic mice as well as in orally challenged food allergic patients. We then compared patients after acute anaphylaxis with several control groups (nonallergic, history of allergen-triggered anaphylaxis, acute cardiovascular/febrile reactions). In this unpaired setting, ApoE levels were unaltered, while ApoA1 was reduced in the anaphylactic group. Although unable to discriminate between anaphylaxis and cardiovascular/febrile reactions, ROC curve analysis revealed a reasonably high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 for ApoA1. Serum 9$\alpha$,11{\ss}-PGF2 , recently identified as a suitable biomarker for anaphylaxis, outperformed ApoA1 with AUC=0.95. Intriguingly however its power further increased upon combination of both mediators reaching AUC=1. Our data suggest that ApoA1 combined with 9$\alpha$,11{\ss}-PGF2 represents a useful composite biomarker of anaphylaxis, achieving superior diagnostic power over either factor alone.},

In such cases the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the setting of refractory shock following anaphylaxis may be life saving. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) itself and in this case complicating ECMO support, is a potentially devastating complication of high-volume resuscitation. Decompressive laparotomy is the treatment of choice for ACS. We present a patient treated with venoarterial ECMO for refractory shock following anaphylaxis who developed ACS that was successfully treated with urgent decompressive laparotomy performed in the intensive care unit. This case report highlights the role of abdominal compartment syndrome as a rare but potentially fatal cause of low circuit flow in ECMO-supported patients and proposes a stepwise approach to decision making in this setting. Urgent decompressive laparotomy is potentially lifesaving in this circumstance, and should be urgently considered once other causes of low ECMO flow have been excluded.},

Anaphylaxis results in wide-spread vasodilation and hypotension. Epinephrine has been described as the drug of choice in the treatment of hypotension for anaphylaxis, but the increased heart rate may be poorly tolerated by some patients. This case report describes a 79-year-old man with a history of diastolic dysfunction who was admitted for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. After induction of general anesthesia, symptoms of anaphy-laxis developed with urticaria and decreased mean arterial pressure. The hypotension was refractory to vasoactive agents and volume repletion. Methylene blue was primed in the cardiopulmonary bypass pump and was effective in restoring hemodynamic stability. Furthermore, the patient required a decreased amount of vasoactive agents in the postoperative course. The suspected mechanism of action of methylene blue is inhibition of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, which ultimately prevents the smooth muscle dilation that accompanies anaphylaxis. Methylene blue may be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of anaphylaxis and other causes of refractory hypotension.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the utility of serum mast cell tryptase to diagnose anaphylaxis. METHODS: As part of a venom immunotherapy trial, we performed 64 sting challenges. Blood samples were taken before the sting (baseline), and 15 min and 60 min after the sting. Tryptase was measured in baseline, 15 minute and 60 minute serum samples. Histamine was measured in baseline and 15 minute plasma samples. Eleven people had undisputed severe anaphylactic reactions; tryptase and histamine levels were assessed against this clinical gold standard diagnosis. RESULTS: Excluding mild reactions from the analysis, peak tryptase readings had sensitivity of 0.36 and specificity of 0.93 using the recommended cut-off range ({\textless} 12.0 microg/L). Receiver-operator curve analysis found a cut-off of 9.0 microg/L would improve diagnostic performance (sensitivity 0.55, specificity 0.93). Serial tryptase measurement was significantly more discriminatory; an increase in tryptase of 2.0 microg/L or greater had a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.98. The addition of histamine measurements, defining a positive result by either a rise in tryptase or a rise in histamine, appeared to further increase sensitivity (0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should use caution when using serum tryptase to refute or support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Serial tryptase measurement increases sensitivity and specificity. Further studies using serial tryptase determinations in general emergency department practice, perhaps supplemented by histamine determinations, are warranted.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide an evidence-based overview of several pharmacotherapeutic options available for refractory anaphylaxis when intramuscular epinephrine, the drug of choice, fails to provide resolution of signs and symptoms. RECENT FINDINGS: The evidence base for the therapy of anaphylaxis is comparatively weak and is largely based on consensus expert recommendations and case reports. There is an increasing recognition that this is problematic. The level of evidence for epinephrine use in anaphylaxis is higher than for other agents. Recent systematic reviews have confirmed the lack of high-grade evidence to support use of antihistamines and corticosteroids in anaphylaxis, both of which statistically continue to be used more frequently than epinephrine. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents have been proffered, but none has been evaluated with scientific rigor. SUMMARY: Some anaphylactic reactions are so severe that treatment is unsuccessful despite rapid recognition and treatment. Improving the evidence base for the various treatment modalities may further help minimize fatalities once anaphylaxis is recognized. Consensus expert recommendations and case reports suggest a number of pharmacotherapeutic agents that are worthy of high-quality scrutiny through randomized controlled studies in which both treatment and placebo arms receive intramuscular epinephrine injections.},

abstract = {Tryptase is a trypsin-type serine protease that is released from mast cells. Bradykinin (BK) is released directly from kininogens or through activation of either Hageman factor or subsequent plasma prekallikrein. Its nasal administration or inhalation induces allergy-like symptoms. Although elevated levels of tryptase and BK in allergic fluids have been detected, the role of this proteinase and the mechanism of BK production at allergic reaction sites are still unknown. To investigate the pathologic functions of tryptase, the enzyme, purified from human lung, was incubated with normal human plasma, deficient plasmas, kininogens, or prekallikrein. High molecular weight kininogen was then added, and the mixtures were examined for vascular permeability enhancement (VPE) activity, a representative function of bradykinin, using guinea pig skin. Tryptase-treated plasma induced VPE in a dose-dependent manner; activity was lost in the absence of a kininase inhibitor but not an antihistamine drug. Tryptase produced VPE activity from normal or Hageman factor-deficient plasma, but only 30{\%} of this activity was produced from prekallikrein-deficient plasma. Significantly, no activity was obtained from kininogen-deficient plasma. Deficient plasma that were reconstituted with each missing factor resulted in VPE-inducing capacity by tryptase, equivalent to that found with normal plasma. Incubation of tryptase with high or low molecular weight kininogen induced VPE activity in a dose- and incubation time-dependent manner. Prekallikrein incubated with tryptase also generated a soybean trypsin inhibitor-sensitive VPE-inducing activity from high molecular weight kininogen. The loss of tryptase VPE-producing activity as a function of incubation time was found to be a result of spontaneous inactivation of the enzyme and not of the degradation of high molecular weight kininogen by the enzyme. We conclude that tryptase induces VPE by releasing BK, primarily through prekallikrein activation, but also through direct release from kininogens. This indicates that this mast cell-derived proteinase contributes to kinin production in allergic diseases.},

abstract = {Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) is an infusion of polyclonal rabbit-derived antibodies against human thymocyte markers, which can be used to prevent and treat acute rejection following organ transplantation. However, the product monograph issued by the manufacturer (Sanofi Canada) reports that serious immune-mediated reactions have been observed following the use of rATG, consisting of anaphylaxis or severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a form of vasoplegic syndrome (VS), in which distributive shock occurs refractory to norepinephrine (NE) and vasopressin (VP). Severe infusion-associated reactions are consistent with CRS and can cause serious cardiac or respiratory problems, or in certain cases, mortality. CRS is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In SIRS, the substantial activation of endothelial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and smooth muscle guanylate cyclase (GC) is observed, which can produce severe hypotension that is unresponsive to conventional vasopressors. Methylene blue (MB) is a direct inhibitor of iNOS and GC and has been used as an effective treatment for VS following cardiothoracic surgery. In the present study, the successful use of MB as a rescue therapy for CRS in a patient receiving rATG following a renal transplant was reported. Following an uneventful cadaveric kidney transplant involving the intravenous (IV) administration of rATG for the induction of immunological tolerance, the patient became markedly hypotensive and tachycardic. The patient required high doses of VP and NE infusions. Following the protocol described for treating refractory VS in post-cardiac surgery patients, the decision was made to initiate the patient on an IV MB infusion. This treatment protocol was shown to improve the hemodynamic status of the patient, which enabled the withdrawal of vasopressors and suggests an important role for methylene blue in the management of refractory VS.},

Methylene blue, a competitive inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, interferes with the vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide. It has recently been proposed by the Joint Taskforce on Practice Parameters as an alternative treatment for anaphylaxis with hypotension that is not responsive to classical therapy. Little evidence supports its use in normotensive patients with refractory anaphylaxis. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with severe anaphylaxis unresponsive to epinephrine. Physical examination revealed marked respiratory distress, raised oral lesions, and altered mental status but lacked hypotension. After infusion of methylene blue, symptom resolution occurred almost immediately, and intubation was spared. Side effects were minimal.

@article{Simons2014,
abstract = {ICON: Anaphylaxis provides a unique perspective on the principal evidence-based anaphylaxis guidelines developed and published independently from 2010 through 2014 by four allergy/immunology organizations. These guidelines concur with regard to the clinical features that indicate a likely diagnosis of anaphylaxis -- a life-threatening generalized or systemic allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. They also concur about prompt initial treatment with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) in the mid-outer thigh, positioning the patient supine (semi-reclining if dyspneic or vomiting), calling for help, and when indicated, providing supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluid resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, along with concomitant monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation. Additionally, they concur that H1-antihistamines, H2-antihistamines, and glucocorticoids are not initial medications of choice. For self-management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis in community settings, they recommend carrying epinephrine auto-injectors and personalized emergency action plans, as well as follow-up with a physician (ideally an allergy/immunology specialist) to help prevent anaphylaxis recurrences. ICON: Anaphylaxis describes unmet needs in anaphylaxis, noting that although epinephrine in 1 mg/mL ampules is available worldwide, other essentials, including supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and epinephrine auto-injectors are not universally available. ICON: Anaphylaxis proposes a comprehensive international research agenda that calls for additional prospective studies of anaphylaxis epidemiology, patient risk factors and co-factors, triggers, clinical criteria for diagnosis, randomized controlled trials of therapeutic interventions, and measures to prevent anaphylaxis recurrences. It also calls for facilitation of global collaborations in anaphylaxis research. IN ADDITION TO CONFIRMING THE ALIGNMENT OF MAJOR ANAPHYLAXIS GUIDELINES, ICON: Anaphylaxis adds value by including summary tables and citing 130 key references. It is published as an information resource about anaphylaxis for worldwide use by healthcare professionals, academics, policy-makers, patients, caregivers, and the public.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or in asthmatic patients. DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Tertiary care, referral-based medical center. PATIENTS Of 28,978 intravenous urographic contrast media procedures done from July 1987 to June 1988, 49 patients experienced moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction. Medical records from these 49 reactors were compared with those from a control group matched for gender, age, and date and type of contrast study who received intravenous urographic contrast media without adverse reaction. MAIN RESULTS Patients exposed to beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma comprised 39{\%} (19 of 49) of reactors, compared to 16{\%} (13 of 83) of matched controls (odds ratio, 3.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.45 to 8.15; P = 0.005). Exposure to beta-blockers was 27{\%} among reactors and 12{\%} in matched controls (odds ratio, 2.67; CI, 1.01 to 7.05; P = 0.036). Asthma was found in 12{\%} of reactors and 4{\%} of controls; after correction for beta-blocker use, asthma was also associated with increased risk for anaphylactoid reaction (odds ratio, 4.54; CI, 1.03 to 20.05; P = 0.046). Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, asthmatic patients were at greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction with bronchospasm (P = 0.02). Five of 13 reactors receiving beta-blockers became hypotensive, and three needed hospitalization. Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, patients exposed to beta-blocking drugs were almost nine times (odds ratio, 8.7; CI, 0.81 to 93.5; P = 0.075) more likely to be hospitalized after an anaphylactoid reaction. CONCLUSION Increased risk for moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma. These patients are appropriate target populations for efforts to reduce risk before intravenous urographic contrast media are administered.},

Observations A case report of a single patient with life-threatening anaphylactic shock to chlorhexidine, who was successfully resuscitated using ECMO. Conclusions We have designed a flowchart for the diagnosis and management of severe anaphylaxis. This case report highlights the potential for chlorhexidine to be a source for the development of refractory anaphylactic shock.

abstract = {We performed a prospective study of anaphylaxis in 25 consecutive patients. Three distinct clinical patterns were observed: uniphasic, biphasic, and protracted anaphylaxis. Thirteen patients (52{\%}) experienced a single episode. Biphasic anaphylaxis occurred in five patients (20{\%}), two episodes of hypotension or laryngeal edema separated by asymptomatic intervals of 1 to 8 hours. Initial therapy included large doses of glucocorticoids in three of the five patients. Seven patients (28{\%}) suffered hypotension, lower respiratory obstruction, or laryngeal obstruction that persisted 5 to 32 hours despite vigorous therapy that included systemic glucocorticoids. Recurrent or prolonged reactions were 2.8-fold more likely if the onset was 30 or more minutes after exposure to the stimulus or if the offending agent had been administered by mouth (p {\textless} 0.03). Fatal reactions occurred in one patient who was taking propranolol and in one who was adrenal insufficient. The results of this study demonstrate that biphasic and protracted anaphylaxis are common, despite glucorticoid therapy. Potentially life-endangering recurrences occurred in five (28{\%}) of the 18 patients who responded to initial therapy. These observations indicate that patients should be followed carefully after apparent remission of anaphylaxis. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers and their effect on patients at risk for anaphylaxis. A literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.},

@article{Brown2006,
abstract = {Anaphylaxis is a severe immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction characterized by life-threatening upper airway obstruction bronchospasm and hypotension. Although many episodes are easy to diagnose by the combination of characteristic skin features with other organ effects, this is not always the case and a workable clinical definition of anaphylaxis and useful biomarkers of the condition have been elusive. A recently proposed consensus definition is ready for prospective validation. The cornerstones of management are the supine position, adrenaline and volume resuscitation. An intramuscular dose of adrenaline is generally recommended to initiate treatment. If additional adrenaline is required, then a controlled intravenous infusion might be more efficacious and safer than intravenous bolus administration. Additional bronchodilator treatment with continuous salbutamol and corticosteroids are used for severe and/or refractory bronchospasm. Aggressive volume resuscitation, selective vasopressors, atropine (for bradycardia), inotropes that bypass the beta-adrenoreceptor and bedside echocardiographic assessment should be considered for hypotension that is refractory to treatment. Management guidelines continue to be opinion- and consensus-based, with retrospective studies accounting for the vast majority of clinical research papers on the topic. The clinical spectrum of anaphylaxis including major disease subgroups requires clarification, and validated scoring systems and outcome measures are needed to enable good-quality prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials. A systematic approach with multicentre collaboration is required to improve our understanding and management of this disease.},

@article{Yee2016,
abstract = {Background: The aim of this paper is to describe clinical management in a situation where patient has experienced anaphylaxis while undergoing surgical septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Case report: A 40-yr-old female was scheduled to undergo surgical septal myectomy for the treatment of HOCM. After induction, the patient developed refractory hypotension that did not respond to escalating doses of vasopressors and volume therapy. Although a clinical examination led to the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, epinephrine, which is the usual treatment of choice, failed to improve the patient's haemodynamics. A transesophageal echocardiography revealed a worsening of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) after epinephrine administration. In the end, the rapid institution of a cardiopulmonary bypass was required as a rescue therapy instead of to save a patient. Conclusion: The anaesthetic goals in a patient in HOCM are to maintain preload and afterload and to avoid stimulation of inotropy and chronotropy to leading to left ventricular outflow obstruction. In a patient with anaphylaxis, maintaining these haemodynamic goals becomes much more difficult since the pathophysiology and usual treatment of choice will worsen LVOTO. Special consideration for the need to have extracorporeal life support to treat refractory hypotension in surgical patients with HOCM may be warranted.},

abstract = {Background Anaphylaxis is a systemic life-threatening allergic reaction that presents unique challenges for emergency care practitioners. Allergists and emergency physicians have a history of collaborating to promote an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to improve the emergency management and follow-up of patients with or at risk of anaphylaxis. Objectives To review recent scientific literature about anaphylaxis, discuss barriers to care, and recommend strategies to support improvement in emergency anaphylaxis care. Methods An expert panel of allergists and emergency physicians was convened by the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in November 2014 to discuss current knowledge about anaphylaxis, identify opportunities for emergency practitioners and allergists to partner to address barriers to care, and recommend strategies to improve medical management of anaphylaxis along the continuum of care: from emergency medical systems and emergency department practitioners for acute management through appropriate outpatient follow-up with allergists to confirm diagnosis, identify triggers, and plan long-term care. Results The panel identified key barriers to anaphylaxis care, including difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis, low rates of epinephrine administration during acute management, and inadequate follow-up. Strategies to overcome these barriers were discussed and recommendations made for future allergist/emergency physician collaborations, and key messages to be communicated to emergency practitioners were proposed. Conclusion The panel recommended that allergists and emergency physicians continue to work in partnership, that allergists be proactive in outreach to emergency care practitioners, and that easy-to-access educational programs and materials be developed for use by emergency medical systems and emergency department practitioners in the training environment and in practice.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE International guidelines recommend dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor agents in septic shock. Phenylephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin and terlipressin are considered second-line agents. Our objective was to assess the evidence for the efficiency and safety of all vasopressors in septic shock. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched electronic database of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, LILACS and conference proceedings up to June 2014. We included randomized controlled trials comparing different vasopressors for the treatment of adult patients with septic shock. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Other clinical and hemodynamic measurements were extracted as secondary outcomes. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were pooled. RESULTS Thirty-two trials (3,544 patients) were included. Compared to dopamine (866 patients, 450 events), norepinephrine (832 patients, 376 events) was associated with decreased all-cause mortality, RR 0.89 (95{\%} CI 0.81-0.98), corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 11{\%} and number needed to treat of 9. Norepinephrine was associated with lower risk for major adverse events and cardiac arrhythmias compared to dopamine. No other mortality benefit was demonstrated for the comparisons of norepinephrine to epinephrine, phenylephrine and vasopressin / terlipressin. Hemodynamic data were similar between the different vasopressors, with some advantage for norepinephrine in central venous pressure, urinary output and blood lactate levels. CONCLUSIONS Evidence suggests a survival benefit, better hemodynamic profile and reduced adverse events rate for norepinephrine over dopamine. Norepinephrine should be regarded as the first line vasopressor in the treatment of septic shock.},

@article{Bauer2013,
abstract = {Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction treated primarily with epinephrine. Methylene blue, a competitive inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, interferes with the vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide. It has recently been proposed by the Joint Taskforce on Practice Parameters as an alternative treatment for anaphylaxis with hypotension that is not responsive to classical therapy. Little evidence supports its use in normotensive patients with refractory anaphylaxis. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with severe anaphylaxis unresponsive to epinephrine. Physical examination revealed marked respiratory distress, raised oral lesions, and altered mental status but lacked hypotension. After infusion of methylene blue, symptom resolution occurred almost immediately, and intubation was spared. Side effects were minimal. We propose methylene blue as a safe treatment option for refractory anaphylaxis, whether with or without hypotension. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Anaphylaxis is in most cases an IgE-dependent immunologic reaction. Mast cells are activated and release several mediators. Recent data about possible triggers of anaphylaxis indicate a clear age-dependency. The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis in children are foods; in adults venom and drugs predominate. In 2006 an anaphylaxis registry was established in German-speaking countries. In the registry the triggers, circumstances, and treatment measures are collected from patients with anaphylaxis. However, the registry cannot supply epidemiological data like prevalence or incidence rates since the registration of cases is based on collaboration with allergy centers only. Similarly, other approaches to obtain data on the epidemiology of anaphylaxis are problematic given that allergic reactions of varying severity are covered by a number of codes in the ICD-10. Research in the field of anaphylaxis is focused on the identification of risk factors. Several data indicate the relevance of co-factors and augmentation factors in well-defined patient groups. Among these factors physical activity, infection, alcohol and additives are relevant. In the future a unique coding system with a subtype analysis regarding the triggers and severity should help to provide data on the epidemiology of anaphylaxis. Furthermore the mechanisms of co-factors and identification of biomarkers for risk assessment are important research areas for the future.},

The most important requirements in the treatment of this clinical condition are early diagnosis and maintenance of vital organ perfusion. Epinephrine administration is generally considered as the first line treatment of anaphylactic reactions. However, recently, new pharmacological approaches have been described in the treatment of different forms of vasoplegic shock. We describe the case of a child who was undergoing surgery for ventricular septal defect, with an anaphylactic reaction to heparin that was refractory to epinephrine infusion and was effectively treated by low dose vasopressin infusion. In case of anaphylactic shock, continuous infusion of low-dose vasopressin might be considered after inadequate response to epinephrine, fluid resuscitation and corticosteroid administration.},

@article{Stocche2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk of perioperative anaphylaxis should always be considered. The incidence of anesthetic allergic reactions is controversial, varying from 1/3,000 to 1/20,000, with mortality range between 3 and 9{\%}. This report describes the use of methylene blue as coadjuvant drug to treat anaphylaxis refractory to conventional therapy. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old male patient was submitted to inguinal hernia correction under spinal anesthesia. After receiving 1.5 g intravenous dipirone at surgery completion, he immediately developed bronchospasm, cyanosis, decreased SpO 2 and SBP, culminating with cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was started with external cardiac massage followed by tracheal intubation, as well as 1 mg epinephrine and 1 mg atropine injections. Heart rate returned (150 bpm) with no palpable pulse though. Additional 1 mg epinephrine and 1 g hydrocortisone were administered with central pulse recovery (8 minutes). Although receiving dopamine (20 $\mu$g.kg -1.min -1), patient remained hypotensive (60 mmHg) until 80 minutes. Intravenous 100 mg methylene blue was then administered with increased SBP to 85 and 105 mmHg after the second dose. Dopamine dose was tapered from 10 to 7, 5 and finally 2 $\mu$g.kg -1.min -1. CONCLUSIONS: Histamine is the major anaphylaxis mediator. Inducing nitric oxide (NO) production, it consequently increases guanylate cyclase, which promotes arteriolar vasodilation by increasing cyclic GMP. Methylene blue may be helpful in such situations because it inhibits guanylate cyclase and consequently vasodilation, resulting in hemodynamic improvement.},

abstract = {Learning Objectives: Distributive shock is common in the critically ill patient. Resuscitation with fluids and catecholamine agents have become standard of care. Methylene blue (MB) has been proposed as an alternative treatment of shock. Methods: A 67-yrold male with history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia on cycle 2 of bendamustine and rituximab, with recent admission for rash and hypotension attributed to allopurinol after cycle 1, developed shortness of breath, chest tightness, and abdominal discomfort while receiving chemotherapy. Treatment was stopped and the patient received fluids, steroids, and diphenhydramine. He became tachycardic, hypertensive, and hypoxic. The patient was intubated for airway protection. Physical exam revealed a diffuse, blanching erythematous rash. Upon arrival to the intensive care unit, he remained normotensive and extremities were well-perfused. He received additional fluids, steroids, and antihistamines. Several hours later, he developed hypotension necessitating initiation of vasopressors. Elevated tryptase level was consistent with clinical diagnosis of anaphylactic shock. Shock was refractory to maximal support on four vasopressors. A four-hour MB infusion was started at 0.5 mg/kg/hr and titrated to 2 mg/kg/hr. Shock improved and the patient was weaned down to three vasopressors. After a short period of time, he again became hypotensive on maximal vasopressor support. Another MB infusion was started and the patient was weaned down to two vasopressors. He did not require additional doses of methylene blue. The patient improved and was discharged home. Results: Reported use of MB for anaphylaxis is limited. Effect of MB on vasodilation has mostly been studied in sepsis. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production is associated with loss of vascular tone in vasodilatory shock. MB inhibits NO-induced guanylate cyclase activation and increases smooth muscle tone. MB may be an effective alternative treatment to restoring vascular tone in anaphylactic shock as evident in our case. Studies are needed to determine ideal dosage, duration of treatment, and effect on mortality.},

abstract = {Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency, and all healthcare professionals should be familiar with its recognition and acute and ongoing management. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Taskforce on Anaphylaxis. They aim to provide evidence-based recommendations for the recognition, risk factor assessment, and the management of patients who are at risk of, are experiencing, or have experienced anaphylaxis. While the primary audience is allergists, these guidelines are also relevant to all other healthcare professionals. The development of these guidelines has been underpinned by two systematic reviews of the literature, both on the epidemiology and on clinical management of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening condition whose clinical diagnosis is based on recognition of a constellation of presenting features. First-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular adrenaline. Useful second-line interventions may include removing the trigger where possible, calling for help, correct positioning of the patient, high-flow oxygen, intravenous fluids, inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, and nebulized adrenaline. Discharge arrangements should involve an assessment of the risk of further reactions, a management plan with an anaphylaxis emergency action plan, and, where appropriate, prescribing an adrenaline auto-injector. If an adrenaline auto-injector is prescribed, education on when and how to use the device should be provided. Specialist follow-up is essential to investigate possible triggers, to perform a comprehensive risk assessment, and to prevent future episodes by developing personalized risk reduction strategies including, where possible, commencing allergen immunotherapy. Training for the patient and all caregivers is essential. There are still many gaps in the evidence base for anaphylaxis.},

abstract = {Intravenous administration of ascaris suum antigen (1 mg) as well as histamine (5 mg) was associated with rapid and marked reductions in cardiac output (QT) and systemic arterial pressure (Pa) in anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs. When venous return was maintained constant by an external pump reservoir system, both antigen and histamine caused rapid reductions in the reservoir blood volume consistent with peripheral pooling. In addition, interruption of the splanchnic arterial inflow by occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta restored the cardiac output to control during histamine shock, whereas QT during antigen shock was unaffected by aortic occlusion, even though the circulatory failure was of similar magnitude. Therefore, we conclude that differences in responses of antigen and histamine shock to aortic occlusion indicate that mechanisms leading to peripheral pooling of blood are different with the two agents. In addition, stability of left atrial pressure following the administration of either agent, when the venous return is maintained constant, suggests that intrinsic myocardial dysfunction is not a major initiating mechanism in the two shock states studied.},

In such cases the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the setting of refractory shock following anaphylaxis may be life saving. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) itself and in this case complicating ECMO support, is a potentially devastating complication of high-volume resuscitation. Decompressive laparotomy is the treatment of choice for ACS. We present a patient treated with venoarterial ECMO for refractory shock following anaphylaxis who developed ACS that was successfully treated with urgent decompressive laparotomy performed in the intensive care unit. This case report highlights the role of abdominal compartment syndrome as a rare but potentially fatal cause of low circuit flow in ECMO-supported patients and proposes a stepwise approach to decision making in this setting. Urgent decompressive laparotomy is potentially lifesaving in this circumstance, and should be urgently considered once other causes of low ECMO flow have been excluded.},

@article{Kemp2014,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide an evidence-based overview of several pharmacotherapeutic options available for refractory anaphylaxis when intramuscular epinephrine, the drug of choice, fails to provide resolution of signs and symptoms. RECENT FINDINGS: The evidence base for the therapy of anaphylaxis is comparatively weak and is largely based on consensus expert recommendations and case reports. There is an increasing recognition that this is problematic. The level of evidence for epinephrine use in anaphylaxis is higher than for other agents. Recent systematic reviews have confirmed the lack of high-grade evidence to support use of antihistamines and corticosteroids in anaphylaxis, both of which statistically continue to be used more frequently than epinephrine. Newer pharmacotherapeutic agents have been proffered, but none has been evaluated with scientific rigor. SUMMARY: Some anaphylactic reactions are so severe that treatment is unsuccessful despite rapid recognition and treatment. Improving the evidence base for the various treatment modalities may further help minimize fatalities once anaphylaxis is recognized. Consensus expert recommendations and case reports suggest a number of pharmacotherapeutic agents that are worthy of high-quality scrutiny through randomized controlled studies in which both treatment and placebo arms receive intramuscular epinephrine injections.},

However, the product monograph issued by the manufacturer (Sanofi Canada) reports that serious immune-mediated reactions have been observed following the use of rATG, consisting of anaphylaxis or severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a form of vasoplegic syndrome (VS), in which distributive shock occurs refractory to norepinephrine (NE) and vasopressin (VP). Severe infusion-associated reactions are consistent with CRS and can cause serious cardiac or respiratory problems, or in certain cases, mortality. CRS is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In SIRS, the substantial activation of endothelial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and smooth muscle guanylate cyclase (GC) is observed, which can produce severe hypotension that is unresponsive to conventional vasopressors. Methylene blue (MB) is a direct inhibitor of iNOS and GC and has been used as an effective treatment for VS following cardiothoracic surgery. In the present study, the successful use of MB as a rescue therapy for CRS in a patient receiving rATG following a renal transplant was reported. Following an uneventful cadaveric kidney transplant involving the intravenous (IV) administration of rATG for the induction of immunological tolerance, the patient became markedly hypotensive and tachycardic. The patient required high doses of VP and NE infusions. Following the protocol described for treating refractory VS in post-cardiac surgery patients, the decision was made to initiate the patient on an IV MB infusion. This treatment protocol was shown to improve the hemodynamic status of the patient, which enabled the withdrawal of vasopressors and suggests an important role for methylene blue in the management of refractory VS.},

abstract = {Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction treated primarily with epinephrine. Methylene blue, a competitive inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, interferes with the vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide. It has recently been proposed by the Joint Taskforce on Practice Parameters as an alternative treatment for anaphylaxis with hypotension that is not responsive to classical therapy. Little evidence supports its use in normotensive patients with refractory anaphylaxis. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with severe anaphylaxis unresponsive to epinephrine. Physical examination revealed marked respiratory distress, raised oral lesions, and altered mental status but lacked hypotension. After infusion of methylene blue, symptom resolution occurred almost immediately, and intubation was spared. Side effects were minimal. We propose methylene blue as a safe treatment option for refractory anaphylaxis, whether with or without hypotension. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ICON: Anaphylaxis provides a unique perspective on the principal evidence-based anaphylaxis guidelines developed and published independently from 2010 through 2014 by four allergy/immunology organizations. These guidelines concur with regard to the clinical features that indicate a likely diagnosis of anaphylaxis -- a life-threatening generalized or systemic allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. They also concur about prompt initial treatment with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (adrenaline) in the mid-outer thigh, positioning the patient supine (semi-reclining if dyspneic or vomiting), calling for help, and when indicated, providing supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluid resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, along with concomitant monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation. Additionally, they concur that H1-antihistamines, H2-antihistamines, and glucocorticoids are not initial medications of choice. For self-management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis in community settings, they recommend carrying epinephrine auto-injectors and personalized emergency action plans, as well as follow-up with a physician (ideally an allergy/immunology specialist) to help prevent anaphylaxis recurrences. ICON: Anaphylaxis describes unmet needs in anaphylaxis, noting that although epinephrine in 1 mg/mL ampules is available worldwide, other essentials, including supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and epinephrine auto-injectors are not universally available. ICON: Anaphylaxis proposes a comprehensive international research agenda that calls for additional prospective studies of anaphylaxis epidemiology, patient risk factors and co-factors, triggers, clinical criteria for diagnosis, randomized controlled trials of therapeutic interventions, and measures to prevent anaphylaxis recurrences. It also calls for facilitation of global collaborations in anaphylaxis research. IN ADDITION TO CONFIRMING THE ALIGNMENT OF MAJOR ANAPHYLAXIS GUIDELINES, ICON: Anaphylaxis adds value by including summary tables and citing 130 key references. It is published as an information resource about anaphylaxis for worldwide use by healthcare professionals, academics, policy-makers, patients, caregivers, and the public.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or in asthmatic patients. DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Tertiary care, referral-based medical center. PATIENTS Of 28,978 intravenous urographic contrast media procedures done from July 1987 to June 1988, 49 patients experienced moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction. Medical records from these 49 reactors were compared with those from a control group matched for gender, age, and date and type of contrast study who received intravenous urographic contrast media without adverse reaction. MAIN RESULTS Patients exposed to beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma comprised 39{\%} (19 of 49) of reactors, compared to 16{\%} (13 of 83) of matched controls (odds ratio, 3.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.45 to 8.15; P = 0.005). Exposure to beta-blockers was 27{\%} among reactors and 12{\%} in matched controls (odds ratio, 2.67; CI, 1.01 to 7.05; P = 0.036). Asthma was found in 12{\%} of reactors and 4{\%} of controls; after correction for beta-blocker use, asthma was also associated with increased risk for anaphylactoid reaction (odds ratio, 4.54; CI, 1.03 to 20.05; P = 0.046). Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, asthmatic patients were at greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction with bronchospasm (P = 0.02). Five of 13 reactors receiving beta-blockers became hypotensive, and three needed hospitalization. Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, patients exposed to beta-blocking drugs were almost nine times (odds ratio, 8.7; CI, 0.81 to 93.5; P = 0.075) more likely to be hospitalized after an anaphylactoid reaction. CONCLUSION Increased risk for moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma. These patients are appropriate target populations for efforts to reduce risk before intravenous urographic contrast media are administered.},

Thirteen patients (52{\%}) experienced a single episode. Biphasic anaphylaxis occurred in five patients (20{\%}), two episodes of hypotension or laryngeal edema separated by asymptomatic intervals of 1 to 8 hours. Initial therapy included large doses of glucocorticoids in three of the five patients. Seven patients (28{\%}) suffered hypotension, lower respiratory obstruction, or laryngeal obstruction that persisted 5 to 32 hours despite vigorous therapy that included systemic glucocorticoids. Recurrent or prolonged reactions were 2.8-fold more likely if the onset was 30 or more minutes after exposure to the stimulus or if the offending agent had been administered by mouth (p {\textless} 0.03). Fatal reactions occurred in one patient who was taking propranolol and in one who was adrenal insufficient. The results of this study demonstrate that biphasic and protracted anaphylaxis are common, despite glucorticoid therapy.

abstract = {The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers and their effect on patients at risk for anaphylaxis. A literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Anaphylaxis is a severe immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction characterized by life-threatening upper airway obstruction bronchospasm and hypotension. Although many episodes are easy to diagnose by the combination of characteristic skin features with other organ effects, this is not always the case and a workable clinical definition of anaphylaxis and useful biomarkers of the condition have been elusive. A recently proposed consensus definition is ready for prospective validation. The cornerstones of management are the supine position, adrenaline and volume resuscitation. An intramuscular dose of adrenaline is generally recommended to initiate treatment. If additional adrenaline is required, then a controlled intravenous infusion might be more efficacious and safer than intravenous bolus administration. Additional bronchodilator treatment with continuous salbutamol and corticosteroids are used for severe and/or refractory bronchospasm. Aggressive volume resuscitation, selective vasopressors, atropine (for bradycardia), inotropes that bypass the beta-adrenoreceptor and bedside echocardiographic assessment should be considered for hypotension that is refractory to treatment. Management guidelines continue to be opinion- and consensus-based, with retrospective studies accounting for the vast majority of clinical research papers on the topic. The clinical spectrum of anaphylaxis including major disease subgroups requires clarification, and validated scoring systems and outcome measures are needed to enable good-quality prospective observational studies and randomized controlled trials. A systematic approach with multicentre collaboration is required to improve our understanding and management of this disease.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of this paper is to describe clinical management in a situation where patient has experienced anaphylaxis while undergoing surgical septal myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Case report: A 40-yr-old female was scheduled to undergo surgical septal myectomy for the treatment of HOCM. After induction, the patient developed refractory hypotension that did not respond to escalating doses of vasopressors and volume therapy. Although a clinical examination led to the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, epinephrine, which is the usual treatment of choice, failed to improve the patient's haemodynamics. A transesophageal echocardiography revealed a worsening of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) after epinephrine administration. In the end, the rapid institution of a cardiopulmonary bypass was required as a rescue therapy instead of to save a patient. Conclusion: The anaesthetic goals in a patient in HOCM are to maintain preload and afterload and to avoid stimulation of inotropy and chronotropy to leading to left ventricular outflow obstruction. In a patient with anaphylaxis, maintaining these haemodynamic goals becomes much more difficult since the pathophysiology and usual treatment of choice will worsen LVOTO.

abstract = {Background Anaphylaxis is a systemic life-threatening allergic reaction that presents unique challenges for emergency care practitioners. Allergists and emergency physicians have a history of collaborating to promote an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to improve the emergency management and follow-up of patients with or at risk of anaphylaxis. Objectives To review recent scientific literature about anaphylaxis, discuss barriers to care, and recommend strategies to support improvement in emergency anaphylaxis care. Methods An expert panel of allergists and emergency physicians was convened by the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in November 2014 to discuss current knowledge about anaphylaxis, identify opportunities for emergency practitioners and allergists to partner to address barriers to care, and recommend strategies to improve medical management of anaphylaxis along the continuum of care: from emergency medical systems and emergency department practitioners for acute management through appropriate outpatient follow-up with allergists to confirm diagnosis, identify triggers, and plan long-term care. Results The panel identified key barriers to anaphylaxis care, including difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis, low rates of epinephrine administration during acute management, and inadequate follow-up. Strategies to overcome these barriers were discussed and recommendations made for future allergist/emergency physician collaborations, and key messages to be communicated to emergency practitioners were proposed. Conclusion The panel recommended that allergists and emergency physicians continue to work in partnership, that allergists be proactive in outreach to emergency care practitioners, and that easy-to-access educational programs and materials be developed for use by emergency medical systems and emergency department practitioners in the training environment and in practice.},

The shock is characterized by severe hypotension and bradycardia, both resistant to adrenaline. These signs were observed in a patient treated with metoprolol for hypertension several months prior to surgery. The intravenous injection of an iodine containing contrast medium during general anaesthesia was followed by a lethal anaphylactoid shock resistant to adrenaline, atropine and isoprenaline. The treatment of the shock needs, besides adrenaline, massive vascular filling, high doses of beta-agonists and glucagon.},

Tables, figures, and charts that should be included to comprehensively assess the results and assumptions to be ver- ified are discussed. This article demonstrates the preferred pattern for the application of logistic methods with an illustra- tion of logistic regression applied to a data set in testing a research hypothesis. Recommendations are also offered for appropriate reporting formats of logistic regression results and the minimum observation-to-predictor ratio. The authors evaluated the use and interpretation of logistic regression pre- sented in 8 articles published in The Journal of Educational Research between 1990 and 2000. They found that all 8 studies met or exceeded recommended criteria. Key},

@article{Worm2013,
abstract = {Anaphylaxis is in most cases an IgE-dependent immunologic reaction. Mast cells are activated and release several mediators. Recent data about possible triggers of anaphylaxis indicate a clear age-dependency. The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis in children are foods; in adults venom and drugs predominate. In 2006 an anaphylaxis registry was established in German-speaking countries. In the registry the triggers, circumstances, and treatment measures are collected from patients with anaphylaxis. However, the registry cannot supply epidemiological data like prevalence or incidence rates since the registration of cases is based on collaboration with allergy centers only. Similarly, other approaches to obtain data on the epidemiology of anaphylaxis are problematic given that allergic reactions of varying severity are covered by a number of codes in the ICD-10. Research in the field of anaphylaxis is focused on the identification of risk factors. Several data indicate the relevance of co-factors and augmentation factors in well-defined patient groups. Among these factors physical activity, infection, alcohol and additives are relevant. In the future a unique coding system with a subtype analysis regarding the triggers and severity should help to provide data on the epidemiology of anaphylaxis. Furthermore the mechanisms of co-factors and identification of biomarkers for risk assessment are important research areas for the future.},

abstract = {In this study, the isolated use of methylene blue (MB) in the treatment of anaphylactic shock induced by Compound 48/80 (C48/80), a potent histamine releaser, was examined, and the study of the effects of MB on the function of the aorta artery endothelium was accomplished in vitro. MB was used in a single 3.0 mg/kg dose, and C48/80 was used in a single 4.5 mg/kg dose. The study protocol included the following experimental groups, containing six animals each: group I (control), animals in the absence of any drug action; group II (MB), MB infusion; Group III (C48/80), anaphylactic shock induced by using C48/80; group IV (C48/80 + MB), anaphylactic shock treated with MB infusion at the moment of major hypotension; and group V (MB + C48/80), prevention of anaphylactic shock with MB by means of MB infusion minutes before the 4.5 mg/kg C48/80 infusion. Nitric oxide plasma levels were measured in each of the experimental groups. After the in vivo studies were performed, an in vitro study was conducted using segments of the abdominal aortas of the rabbits to determine the effect of MB on the arterial endothelium. The results obtained in the present investigation have shown that MB intravenous infusion does not change the mean arterial pressure when compared with the control group (n = 6 in each group, P {\textless} 0.05); that C48/80 is effective in producing experimental anaphylactic shock (n = 6, P {\textless} 0.05); that the attempt to prevent anaphylactic shock with MB results in a mean prolongation of animal survival ranging from 17 to 34 min (n = 6 in each group, P {\textless} 0.05); that MB is effective in reversing anaphylactic shock in all the studied rabbits (n = 6, P {\textless} 0.05); that absolute and percentage plasma nitrate values obtained with the experimental groups do not differ (n = 6, each group, P {\textless} 0.05); and that the in vitro study of segments of abdominal aorta has shown that there has not been endothelial dysfunction in any of the groups (n = 6 in each group, P {\textless} 0.05). The good results obtained in this study open a research path that may offer data to define new paradigms for treating anaphylaxis.},

In addition, interruption of the splanchnic arterial inflow by occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta restored the cardiac output to control during histamine shock, whereas QT during antigen shock was unaffected by aortic occlusion, even though the circulatory failure was of similar magnitude. Therefore, we conclude that differences in responses of antigen and histamine shock to aortic occlusion indicate that mechanisms leading to peripheral pooling of blood are different with the two agents. In addition, stability of left atrial pressure following the administration of either agent, when the venous return is maintained constant, suggests that intrinsic myocardial dysfunction is not a major initiating mechanism in the two shock states studied.},

abstract = {Guanylyl cyclases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of GTP to cGMP. The family comprises both membrane-bound and soluble isoforms that are expressed in nearly all cell types. They are regulated by diverse extracellular agonists that include peptide hormones, bacterial toxins, and free radicals, as well as intracellular molecules, such as calcium and adenine nucleotides. Stimulation of guanylyl cyclases and the resultant accumulation of cGMP regulates complex signaling cascades through immediate downstream effectors, including cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Guanylyl cyclases and cGMP-mediated signaling cascades play a central role in the regulation of diverse (patho)physiological processes, including vascular smooth muscle motility, intestinal fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, and retinal phototransduction. Topics addressed in this review include the structure and chromosomal localization of the genes for guanylyl cyclases, structure and function of the members of the guanylyl cyclase family, molecular mechanisms regulating enzymatic activity, and molecular sequences coupling ligand binding to catalytic activity. A brief overview is presented of the downstream events controlled by guanylyl cyclases, including the effectors that are regulated by cGMP and the role that guanylyl cyclases play in cell physiology and pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Vasoplegia syndrome is a well known complication after cardiac surgery and has a significant morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by profound vasodilation and loss of systemic vascular resistance leading to hypotension. The pathogenesis of vasoplegia involves the activation of contact, coagulation and complement systems and the activation of leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells resulting in an imbalance in the regulation of the vascular tone leading to postcardiac surgery vasoplegia. Multiple risk factors have been identified that help predict vasoplegia. Treatment requires mainly vasopressors, but hypotension can be refractory to vasopressors. Some studies suggest that methylene blue can reverse refractory hypotension in these patients and may prevent the development of the syndrome, but more studies are needed with this drug. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of the vasoplegia syndrome and associated risk factors for this complication and briefly outline current therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To review the role of nitric oxide production in anaphylaxis. DATA SOURCES We performed MEDLINE searches of the literature. In addition, some references known to the authors but not listed in MEDLINE, such as abstracts and a CD-ROM, were included. Finally, additional clinical details of the cases were provided by one of the authors. STUDY SELECTION Primary reports were preferentially selected for inclusion. However, some secondary publications are also cited. RESULTS Histamine along with other mediators, such as leukotrienes, tumor necrosis factor, and platelet-activating factor, induce the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide can inhibit the release and effects of catecholamines. Sympathetic amines may inhibit production of nitric oxide. Studies in animals have demonstrated the generation of nitric oxide during anaphylaxis. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase improves survival in an animal model of anaphylaxis. Nitric oxide causes vasodilation indirectly by increasing the activation of guanylyl cyclase, which then causes smooth muscle relaxation by increasing the concentration of smooth muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Methylene blue is an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, which increases systemic vascular resistance and reverses shock in animal studies. The previously reported successful treatment with methylene blue of 11 patients with anaphylactic hypotension is reviewed. CONCLUSION Nitric oxide plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis. Treatment with methylene blue should be considered in patients with anaphylactic hypotension that has not responded to other interventions.},

abstract = {We describe a patient who developed a type I anaphylactic reaction to intravenous cefazolin. The patient had no known drug allergies and had previously received intraoperative intravenous cefazolin 2 months prior without any problems. Forty-fives after receiving cefazolin 1 g i.v. and while fully awake, the patient experienced shortness of breath, became unconscious, and then suffered a cardiac arrest. Resuscitation included endotracheal intubation, external cardiac compression, electrical defibrillation and multiple large doses of epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate over the course of 2.5 h and three cardiac arrests. Nevertheless, the patient fully recovered. The intent of this case report is to address widely held concerns regarding cross-reactivity of cephalosporin, particularly cefazolin, to penicillin, the legitimacy of test dosing as a means to safely identify patients who will have an allergic reaction to cephalosporins and comment on patient-related predictors of survival following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the good outcome in this case.},

@article{Liu2005,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report a rare but severe reaction of refractory anaphylactic shock with ketoconazole treatment-associated hypotensive episodes in an elderly patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old woman received antifungal therapy for her almost completely occluded cornea infected with Candida albicans. She was initially prescribed oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. She developed hypotension over the first 2 days of therapy (BP 136/82 mm Hg at baseline; 90/50 mm Hg on day 2). Severe hypotension (BP 90/49 mm Hg) unresponsive to fluid therapy or high-dose dopamine developed on day 4 of therapy. An invasive Swan-Ganz catheterization study showed a very low level of peripheral vascular resistance with high cardiac output index without clinical signs of infection. When laboratory tests showed a high level of plasma tryptase, anaphylactic redistribution shock was diagnosed. Her vital signs became more stable after treatment with hydrocortisone and epinephrine infusion. She was discharged in good condition after 24 hours of observation. DISCUSSION: As of December 2004, refractory anaphylactic shock resulting from ketoconazole use had not been reported. The events of hypotension were strongly associated with the intake of ketoconazole. The hemodynamic results obtained with Swan-Ganz catheterization were compatible with anaphylactic shock. The Naranjo probability scale showed a probable association of the adverse event with ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Ketoconazole may cause severe anaphylactic shock even when taken orally. Invasive catheterization and elevated tryptase levels can provide important information in the management of anaphylactic shock},
